Every year new students get admitted to Birzeit University, and lot of visitors came too. These people usually have a smart-phone which has a sensor that can determine your location. People feel more comfortable with using phones rather than any other devices. So we decide to take advantage of these facts and build a mobile application will increase student's productivity by find the shortest path between any two locations inside the university campus, and find the visitor's destination within a reasonably time. No need for asking people and get lost anymore.

There are many applications provide people with directions and navigation such as Google-map, waze...Etc. these applications are easy to use and have tons of features. But inside the university campus there is a lot of limitation so here we go. we will take advantages of Google's APIs to achieve that.
