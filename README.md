#Abstract
We decide to build a mobile application (Android) which increase student's productivity, and give visitors the best of joy by finding the shortest path between any two locations inside the university campus. No need for asking people and get lost anymore.

A lot of applications provide us with navigation services, such as Google-map, waze...etc, these applications are easy to use and have tons of features. But inside the university campus there is a lot of limitation so here we go. we will take advantages of Google's APIs to achieve that.
